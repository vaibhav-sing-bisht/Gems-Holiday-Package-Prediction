## Gems-Holiday-Package-Prediction
This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction.

In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. 

In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.  Skills and Tools  Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear discriminant Analysis

## Problem 1: Linear Regression


You are hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer. You are provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). The company is earning different profits on different prize slots. You have to help the company in predicting the price for the stone on the bases of the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones so as to have better profit share. Also, provide them with the best 5 attributes that are most important.

Y	 Width of the cubic zirconia in mm.
Z	 Height of the cubic zirconia in mm.

## Problem 2: Logistic Regression and LDA


You are hired by a tour and travel agency which deals in selling holiday packages. You are provided details of 872 employees of a company. Among these employees, some opted for the package and some didn't. You have to help the company in predicting whether an employee will opt for the package or not on the basis of the information given in the data set. Also, find out the important factors on the basis of which the company will focus on particular employees to sell their packages.
